# Coordinate System
We are using a cylindrical coordinate system. Since we will have two operations for
moving the claw, height and rotation of the base. Hence our coordinate system is (r, Theta, h). Our radius r is always set to 1 since the radius will not increase. Theta is the angle of the base and h is the height of the claw.
